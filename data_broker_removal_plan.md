# Data Broker Removal Agent - Implementation Plan

## 1. Approach

### Core Strategy
The app will use an AI agent-based approach with LangGraph to orchestrate complex workflows for automated data broker removal requests. The system will combine web scraping, email automation, and intelligent decision-making to handle the diverse removal processes across different data brokers.

### Key Principles
- **Adaptive Processing**: Each data broker has unique removal processes, so the agent must be flexible and learn from website structures
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: For complex cases or failures, escalate to human review via Linear tasks
- **Comprehensive Tracking**: Maintain detailed logs of all interactions and statuses
- **Privacy-First**: Secure handling of sensitive user data throughout the process
- **Scalable Architecture**: Support multiple users and concurrent processing
