```

### 4. Run the Script
```bash
python create_linear_tasks.py
```

## What Gets Created

The script will create:

1. **One Project/Epic**: "Data Broker Removal Agent" - Overall project container
2. **10 Major Tasks** organized by implementation phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)
- **Infrastructure Setup** - Development environment, Supabase, email service, monitoring
- **Database Design & Core Framework** - Schemas, LangGraph setup, FastAPI, authentication

### Phase 2: Core Agent Development (Weeks 3-5)  
- **Pattern Matching & Learning Agents** - Pattern system for reusable removal workflows
- **Website Analysis & Form Submission Agents** - Web scraping and form automation
- **Email & Communication Agents** - Email handling and user communication

### Phase 3: Data Broker Integration (Weeks 6-8)
- **Data Broker Research & Cataloging** - Research and document 50+ brokers
- **Automated Broker Processing** - Pattern-first processing with learning

### Phase 4: Status Tracking (Weeks 9-10)
- **Request Status & Tracking System** - Comprehensive status management

### Phase 5: User Interface (Weeks 11-12)
- **Frontend & API Development** - User interface and REST API

### Phase 6: Testing & QA (Weeks 13-14)
- **Testing & Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive testing and error handling

### Phase 7: Deployment (Weeks 15-16)
- **Production Deployment & Launch** - Production setup and launch preparation

## Task Details

Each task includes:
- **Detailed description** with specific sub-tasks
- **Acceptance criteria** for completion
- **Priority level** (1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low)
- **Time estimates** in story points
- **Phase organization** for logical grouping

## Total Effort Estimate
- **10 major tasks**
- **Approximately 161 story points total**
- **16-week timeline**
- **Target: 100+ removal requests per hour processing capacity**

## Note on Linear Integration

This Linear setup is for **internal development tracking only**. The actual Data Broker Removal Agent uses **email-based human-in-the-loop** communication with users, not Linear integration for user-facing workflows.

Linear integration in the agent itself is optional and only used for:
- Internal bug tracking
- Development task management  
- System operational issues
- Team workflow coordination
